Placeables
**********

.. versionadded:: 0.4

Placeables are special parts of the text that can be automatically highlighted
and easily inserted into the translation. By using placeables, a translator can
avoid certain errors, such as retyping numbers or acronyms incorrectly, or
perhaps introducing an error when retyping some program codes, such as XML.
Virtaal will help you to insert these placeables easily, and save you time
because you don't have to type them.

You can choose which placeables Virtaal should recognise in the preferences.
Virtaal will visually highlight the placeables that it recognises in the text.

- Numbers
- Acronyms
- XML
- E-mail addresses and URLs
- Variables used in software localisation
- Inline tags in XLIFF files
