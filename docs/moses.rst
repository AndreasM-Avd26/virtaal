`Moses <http://www.statmt.org/moses/>`_ is Free software for machine
translation (MT). Moses is a statistical machine translation system that allows
you to automatically train translation models for any language pair. All you
need is a collection of translated texts (parallel corpus).

The Virtaal plugin provides the Moses machine translation output as
suggestions. Read on the Moses website how to get a Moses server running, and
configure the settings in your tm.ini file.

Remember that the suggestions from the Moses plugin are unreviewed
machine-generated translations, that could be wrong, inaccurate, or flawed in
some other way. It is meant as a way to help you increase your productivity,
not to substitute the expertise of a human translator.
