Google Translate
****************

`Google Translate <http://translate.google.com/>`_ is a free service for
machine translation (MT). Familiarise yourself with Google's `terms of service
<http://code.google.com/intl/af-ZA/apis/ajaxlanguage/terms.html>`_. 

Virtaal has a plugin since version 0.5 to provide the output of Google
Translate as suggestions.

The plugin queries a web service over the Internet, and suggestions might
therefore take a moment before they are displayed. Also keep in mind that your
source text is sent unencrypted over the Internet, and therefore no
confidential translation should be done using this plug-in.

Remember that the suggestions from the Google Translate plugin are unreviewed
machine-generated translations, that could be wrong, inaccurate, or flawed in
some other way. It is meant as a way to help you increase your productivity,
not to substitute the expertise of a human translator.
