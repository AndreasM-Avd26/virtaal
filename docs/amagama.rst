Amagama
=======
Virtaal has a plugin since version 0.7 to provide TM suggestions from Amagama.
Amagama contains translations of FOSS projects.

The plugin queries a web service over the Internet, and suggestions might
therefore take a moment before they are displayed. Also keep in mind that your
source text is sent unencrypted over the Internet, and therefore no
confidential translation should be done using this plug-in.

Remember that the suggestions from the Amagama plugin come from a variety of
sources, and might not be perfect for what you need. It is meant as a way to
help you increase your productivity, but still needs your expertise.
