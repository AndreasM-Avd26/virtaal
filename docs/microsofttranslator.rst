Microsoft Translator
********************

`Microsoft Translator <http://www.microsofttranslator.com/>`_ (also known as
Bing Translator) is a free service for machine translation (MT). Familiarise
yourself with the `Microsoft Service Agreement
<http://help.live.com/help.aspx?project=tou>`_. 

Virtaal has a plugin since version 0.6 to provide the output of Microsoft
Translator as suggestions.

The plugin queries a web service over the Internet, and suggestions might
therefore take a moment before they are displayed. Also keep in mind that your
source text is sent unencrypted over the Internet, and therefore no
confidential translation should be done using this plug-in.

Remember that the suggestions from the Microsoft Translator plugin are
unreviewed machine-generated translations, that could be wrong, inaccurate, or
flawed in some other way. It is meant as a way to help you increase your
productivity, not to substitute the expertise of a human translator.
