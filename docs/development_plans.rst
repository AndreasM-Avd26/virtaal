Virtaal Roadmap
***************
Changes to Virtaal will be guided by these guidelines:

- The Virtaal interface must be good looking and simple
- We will optimise for the most frequent use cases
- There should be no necessity for the mouse
- The most important information must be visible by default
- Only relevant (actional) widgets should be shown
- Maximum functionality without setup and configuration
