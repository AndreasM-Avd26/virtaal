Virtaal Roadmap
***************
Changes to Virtaal will be guided by these guidelines:

- The Virtaal interface must be good looking and simple
- We will optimise for the most frequent use cases
- There should be no necessity for the mouse
- The most important information must be visible by default
- Only relevant (actional) widgets should be shown
- Maximum functionality without setup and configuration

<http://bugs.locamotion.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&order=relevance+desc&bug_status=__open__&product=Virtaal&content=>`_.

Features that are likely to be developed in the foreseeable future:

- Improved searching (to take accelerators into account, for example)
- Better support for XLIFF features
- Support for more formats - ongoing
