Building
--------
# Setup jhbuild your .jhbuild-custom should contain the following
setup_sdk(target="10.5", sdk_version="10.5", architectures=["i386"])
build_policy = "updated-deps"
moduleset="http://github.com/jralls/gtk-osx-build/raw/master/modulesets-stable/gtk-osx.modules"
_gtk_osx_use_jhbuild_python = True # Needed because we're going to bundle Virtaal

# Actual build
jhbuild bootstrap --ignore-system
jhbuild --moduleset=dev/virtaal.modules build berkeleydb
jhbuild --moduleset=bootstrap.modules buildone --force python # This rebuilds python - oh well
jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-bootstrap meta-gtk-osx-core meta-gtk-osx-python
jhbuild --moduleset=dev/virtaal.modules build virtaal

# Test the build
jhbuild shell
virtaal

# Buncle the build
jhbuild shell
chmod +w $PREFIX/lib/libpython2.7.dylib
ige-mac-bundler ~/dev/virtaal-mac/virtaal.bundle

# Make a .dmg file
Make dmg based on gramps guidelines

Done!

# These mostly follow http://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Using_GRAMPS_on_Apple_Mac
# But there is more info in the actual gramps.modules file https://gramps.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gramps/trunk/mac/gramps.modules
# spefic to --ignore-system etc when bundling.

You can use --force if you want everything to rebuild or buildone to just do that module, no dependencies

Todo
----
* Commit various in tree changes to the repo
        * Why don't we install icons/hicolor/24x24/mimetypes/x-translation.png? - setup.py changed for Mac
        * Why do we get: Exception: Could not find "themes/OSX_Leopard_theme/gtkrc" - setup.py changed for Mac
* Get pango working for Arabic
* Investigate/Find patch that allows environment variable to set the PANGO module directory
* Cleanup Plist, runvirtaal etc so that we are rid of gramps stuff that we don't need
* Fix the .accel so that commands keys are more Macish http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/wiki/Integrate
        http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=27058398
* Prettier installer
* Hello World and Python console plugins are showing in the build
* Might want to use a newer pycairo - can't find what changed though
* PyObjC breaks when building pyobjc-core - we need this for native dialogs
          Below regers to some notes on using PyObjC for native file dialogs
          http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=AANLkTikUhZpPrg6VdXu64QBw8V1iGTXd5oZ6NCT%2BYrkv%40mail.gmail.com&forum_name=gtk-osx-users
          http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=26149496
* import CoreFoundations - part of ObjC needed to get the Mac locale setting
* Investigate using python 2.6 so that we can use CoreFoundation that is on the Mac already, maybe we need to compile our own gcc?
* Enable or disable spell checker on Poedit settings import
* Investigate dmg script in ige-mac-bundler so that we can build th DMG from script
* Do we need to understand this for our builds? http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/wiki/SnowLeopard
* Localise GtkOSXApplication.strings http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/wiki/Integrate
* Trim to save space: themes, translations (Mac + Ones we support, drop others), icons we don't use (sizes?)
* Review our theme engine and the issue of Quartz being crap
* Build completely from scratch, no downloaded or checked out files (don't lose the patches!)
* Make localisation work
* Bundle our translations i.e. lite
* Drop libtranslate from Mac
* Bundle psycopg for tinytm
* Review gramps pacths found in gramps.modules like https://github.com/jralls/gtk-osx-build/raw/master/patches/gramps-macui.patch
* Compile Sqlite with fts3 support, since we're compiling Python anyway we might as well do this
        See http://developer.gnome.org/jhbuild/stable/moduleset-syntax.html.en#moduleset-syntax-defs-autotools
* Some bugs reported by JC on the mailing list
        * Don't use $LANG to set UI language see http://lists.apple.com/archives/applescript-users/2011/May/msg00077.html
        * Clarify import information, doesn't say that we're importing from translation programs and what we'll import
        * Migration dialog title is too short
* Start Virtaal when clicking supported files in the finder

Installer

Issues
------
ige-mac-integration seems to have a problem installing (might be some folder with no Makefile)
        See https://trac.macports.org/ticket/28443
        Added __init__.py in bindings/python/gtk_osxapplixation with 'from _gtk_osxapplication import *'
        Tried - removeing __init__.pyc - assumed with no .py this was not wanted
        Lastly, copied __init__.py from 0.9.6 to 0.9.7
        Don't forget we want ige-mac-integration-python NOT ige-mac-integration

CoreFoundation is available on Mac python but not on our pythin builds.
Seems to be part of pyobjc but can't work out what needs to be built for 
that software to install CoreFoundation correctly.

Careful
-------
Make sure only one arch is set using setup_blah as some compiles can't happen with two archs
