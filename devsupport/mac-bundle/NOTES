Building
--------
# Setup jhbuild 
# Your .jhbuild-custom should contain the following
setup_sdk(target="10.5", sdk_version="10.5", architectures=["i386"]) # Make sure there is only one of these.  Some compiles with two archs can't happen
build_policy = "updated-deps"
moduleset="http://github.com/jralls/gtk-osx-build/raw/master/modulesets-stable/gtk-osx.modules"
_gtk_osx_use_jhbuild_python = True # Needed because we're going to bundle python with Virtaal

# Actual build
jhbuild bootstrap --ignore-system
jhbuild --moduleset=dev/virtaal.modules build berkeleydb
jhbuild --moduleset=bootstrap.modules buildone --force python # This rebuilds python - oh well
jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-bootstrap meta-gtk-osx-core meta-gtk-osx-python
jhbuild --moduleset=dev/virtaal.modules build virtaal

# Test the build
jhbuild shell
virtaal

# Bundle the build
jhbuild shell
chmod +w $PREFIX/lib/libpython2.7.dylib
ige-mac-bundler ~/dev/virtaal-mac/virtaal.bundle

# Make a .dmg file
Make dmg based on gramps guidelines

Done!

# These mostly follow http://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Using_GRAMPS_on_Apple_Mac
# But there is more info in the actual gramps.modules file https://gramps.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gramps/trunk/mac/gramps.modules
# spefic to --ignore-system etc when bundling.

You can use --force if you want everything to rebuild or buildone to just do that module, no dependencies

Todo
----
# Urgent (we can't release and rebuild without it)
* Commit various in tree changes to the repo
        * Why don't we install icons/hicolor/24x24/mimetypes/x-translation.png? - setup.py changed for Mac
        * Why do we get: Exception: Could not find "themes/OSX_Leopard_theme/gtkrc" - setup.py changed for Mac
* Making DMG
        * Investigate dmg script in ige-mac-bundler so that we can build th DMG from script
        * Document process more clearly
* Build completely from scratch, no downloaded or checked out files (don't lose the patches!)
        * pycurl - trying to build against static libs should remove --static-libs from the pycurl setup.py. Need to use a tarball instead of CVS

# Important (some of our users are affected)
* Pango things
        * CoreText seems to be our way forward for correct font fallback
        * See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=611943 - CoreText backend implemented
        * See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=647969 - Font fallback still needed for CoreText
* Sync'ing menus from plugins see gtk_osxapplication_sync_menubar ()
* Recent files works from welcome screen but File->Recent Files keeps opening the last opened file
* Fix the .accel so that commands keys are more Macish http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/wiki/Integrate
        http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=27058398
        * Left and right key don't work in a unit but move between placeables

# Nice to have (it would look cooler)
* Link the NSXXXXX closing signal to anything we need
        * Close tmserver that we've launched
* Use Sparkle to notify users of updates
        * See http://thoughts.seul.in/2009/11/loading-sparkle-and-other-frameworks-in-pyobjc/
        * http://www.google.com/codesearch/p?hl=en#43CtZj1WSp0/tv/platform/osx/plat/frontends/widgets/sparkleupdater.py&q=loadBundle%20Sparkle&sa=N&cd=3&ct=rc

# Icons and graphics

# Not urgent (we can live without these for now)
* Cleanup Plist, runvirtaal etc so that we are rid of gramps stuff that we don't need
* Prettier installer
        * Localised file names: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFileSystem/Articles/DisplayNames.html
          We can make the terms REAME and LICENSE localisable
* Hello World and Python console plugins are showing in the build
* Might want to use a newer pycairo - can't find what changed though
* Investigate using python 2.6 so that we can use CoreFoundation that is on the Mac already, maybe we need to compile our own gcc?
* Enable or disable spell checker on Poedit settings import
* Do we need to understand this for our builds? http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/wiki/SnowLeopard
* Trim to save space: themes, translations (Mac + Ones we support, drop others), icons we don't use (sizes?)
* Review our theme engine and the issue of Quartz being crap
* Make localisation work
* Bundle our translations i.e. lite
* Drop libtranslate from Mac
* Bundle psycopg for tinytm
* Review gramps pacths found in gramps.modules like https://github.com/jralls/gtk-osx-build/raw/master/patches/gramps-macui.patch
* Some bugs reported by JC on the mailing list
        * Clarify import information, doesn't say that we're importing from translation programs and what we'll import
        * Migration dialog title is too short
* Build libcurl with IDN support - only needed if we ever have a way to retreive other people's URLs from the app
* Should we store our configuration in ~/Library/Preferences where we can access them with the /usr/bin/defaults command?
* Get name and email address from mac preferences
