Building
--------
jhbuild bootstrap --ignore-system
jhbuild --moduleset=dev/virtaal.modules build berkeleydb
jhbuild --moduleset=bootstrap.modules buildone --force python # This rebuilds python - oh well
jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-bootstrap meta-gtk-osx-core meta-gtk-osx-python
jhbuild --moduleset=dev/virtaal.modules build virtaal

jhbuild shell
virtaal

jhbuild shell
chmod +w $PREFIX/lib/libpython2.7.dylib
ige-mac-bundler ~/dev/virtaal-mac/virtaal.bundle

Make dmg based on gramps guidelines

Done!

# These mostly follow http://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Using_GRAMPS_on_Apple_Mac
# But there is more info in the actual gramps.modules file https://gramps.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gramps/trunk/mac/gramps.modules
# spefic to --ignore-system etc when bundling.

You can use --force if you want everything to rebuild or buildone to just do that module, no dependencies

Todo
----
* Clean jhbuild - done, reran a second time and fixed up a few errors
* Running app - done
* Packaged .app - done using ige-mac-builder
* Move menu to title bar use gtkos_application - done
* .dmg - done, simple not fancy
* Migration - bsddb is being deprecated and isn't built on Mac - done, made bsddb optional, compiled for jhbuild
* Migration - can import personal info for Poedit on Mac
* Why don't we install icons/hicolor/24x24/mimetypes/x-translation.png? - setup.py changed for Mac
* Why do we get: Exception: Could not find "themes/OSX_Leopard_theme/gtkrc" - setup.py changed for Mac
* Check pango configuration so that we can do Arabic - done, fixed .bundle to include all modules not just basic - doesn't seem to work though!
* Package glib2, gtk2 and gtkspell translations - done
* Sort out langmaodels for lang detection - done, just needed packaging
* Makefile of python on Mac included in bundle also include/python2.7 - done, solved the startup on 10.5
* New laucnher.sh script - done, take from pygtk example
* Package tmserver so that we can run localtm - done, seems we just needed to define PATH

* Cleanup Plist, runvirtaal etc so that we are rid of gramps stuff that we don't need
* Fix the .accel so that commands keys are more Macish http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/wiki/Integrate
* Spell checker and other stuff bundling into .app
* Prettier installer
* Hello World and Python console plugins are showing in the build
* Might want to use a newer pycairo - can't find what changed though
* PyObjC breaks when building pyobjc-core - we need this for native dialogs
* import CoreFoundations - part of ObjC needed to get the Mac locale setting
* Investigate using python 2.6 so that we can use CoreFoundation that is on the Mac already, maybe we need to compile our own gcc?
* Enable or disable spell checker on Poedit settings import
* Investigate dmg script in ige-mac-bundler so that we can build th DMG from script
* Investigate/Find patch that allows environment variable to set the PANGO module directory
* Do we need to understand this for our builds? http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/wiki/SnowLeopard
* Localise GtkOSXApplication.strings http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/wiki/Integrate
* Trim to save space: themes, translations (Mac + Ones we support, drop others), icons we don't use (sizes?)
* Review our theme engine and the issue of Quartz being crap
* Build completely from scratch, no downloaded or checked out files (don't lose the patches!)
* Make localisation work
* Bundle our translations i.e. lite
* Cleanup menu dividers, we seem to have extras
* Drop libtranslate from Mac
* Review gramps pacths found in gramps.modules like https://github.com/jralls/gtk-osx-build/raw/master/patches/gramps-macui.patch
* Compile Sqlite with fts3 support, since we're compiling Python anyway we might as well do this
        See http://developer.gnome.org/jhbuild/stable/moduleset-syntax.html.en#moduleset-syntax-defs-autotools

* Why do we build our own python? Even if its to bsddb maybe its too much pain

Issues
------
ige-mac-integration seems to have a problem installing (might be some folder with no Makefile)
        See https://trac.macports.org/ticket/28443
        Added __init__.py in bindings/python/gtk_osxapplixation with 'from _gtk_osxapplication import *'
        Tried - removeing __init__.pyc - assumed with no .py this was not wanted
        Lastly, copied __init__.py from 0.9.6 to 0.9.7
        Don't forget we want ige-mac-integration-python NOT ige-mac-integration

CoreFoundation is available on Mac python but not on our pythin builds.
Seems to be part of pyobjc but can't work out what needs to be built for 
that software to install CoreFoundation correctly.

Careful
-------
Make sure only one arch is set using setup_blah as some compiles can't happen with two archs
